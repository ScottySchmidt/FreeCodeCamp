# View my hundreds of web development projects here: https://codepen.io/ScottFSchmidt/pens/showcase
# Around 2018, I completed a front-end certificate from FreeCodeCamp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/

# Most of these projects are in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 
# Some are the projects are now really "easy" looking back a few years ago.
# However, I would like to just post a few of my favorite projects.
# These projects may not be impressive, but it shows how progress of how much I have developed.
